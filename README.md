# Spot-it-fast (YOLOv3 Real-Time Object Detection for Autonomous Systems)
YOLOv3-based real-time object detection system optimized for speed and vision intelligence in autonomous and edge environments.
Implemented a fully operational YOLOv3-based detection pipeline with real-time object recognition and bounding box overlays, pushing computer vision toward deployable autonomy.

## Highlights
- Utilized pretrained YOLOv3 weights on COCO dataset
- Visualized object tracking across frames at near real-time latency
- Benchmarked vs HOG, Haar Cascade, and LiDAR-based systems

## Tech Stack
`YOLOv3`, `CNN`, `OpenCV`, `Python`, `COCO Dataset`

## Outcomes
- Delivered sub-100ms frame processing
- Presented as a prototype for lightweight AV perception stack
